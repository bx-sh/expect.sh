## `expect`

The `expect` function provides a simple framework for authoring and using "expectations"

```sh
local config="file.conf"

expect "$config" toBeValidConfig

expect { deployed --configs } not toContain "$config"

expect {{ deploy "$config" }} toOutput "Successfully deployed $config"

expect { deployed --configs } toContain "$config"
```

> All applications and scripts are different.
>
> Please use this to implement your own domain-specific expectations for your tests.

# Authoring Expectations

## Expectations vs Assertions

The two most common test assertion styles in programming languages are:

> #### `assert`
>
> ```sh
> assert_equal "ACTUAL", "EXPECTED"
> ```

> #### `expect`
>
> ```sh
> expect "ACTUAL" equals "EXPECTED"
> ```

There are pros and cons to each, but at the end of the day it comes down to user preference.

`assert`

- Pros:
  - Classic ü•Ç
  - Easy to implement additional `assert_*` functions
- Cons:
  - Easy to forget which argument is `actual` and which is `expected`
  - Requires many `assert_*` functions
    > in BASH, these "pollute" the global namespace

`expect`

- Pros:
  - Reads closer to normal language, e.g. _expect '\$result' to equal 'foo'_
  - Only requires one top-level `expect` function
    > in BASH, this means not "polluting" the global namespace with extra functions
- Cons:
  - Slightly more complicated to implement additional `expect` matchers
    > ... as you'll see below! You'll implement a variety of matchers üçª

---

## Matcher functions

Let's implement the following **`toEq`** "matcher function"

```sh
expect "$answer" toEq 42
```

First, try running the above code _without_ implementing the function:

- ```sh
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  # expect.matcher.toEq: command not found
  ```

You'll see an error: **`expect.matcher.toEq: command not found`**

By default, `expect` expects a function to exist named `expect.matcher.[MATCHER_NAME]`

The name of the matcher in this case is: `toEq`.

## Write a matcher function

Next, add that function: **`expect.matcher.toEq()`**

To start with, just print out one thing:

1.  Information about the arguments being passed to the function

    ```sh
    expect.matcher.toEq() {
      echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
    }
    ```

    > You can define the above function right in your BASH shell, just copy/paste it in!

Now, try running the code again:

- ```sh
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: 42
  ```

Wonderful! This time the command did not fail and the `toEq` function was called.

As you can see, the `toEq` function received one positional argument: `42`

This is considered the **"expected result"**.

- > #### Optional
  >
  > Try passing additional arguments to `toEq`
  >
  > ```sh
  > $ expect "$answer" toEq 42 another argument "hello, world!"
  > # toEq called with 4 arguments: 42 another argument hello, world!
  > ```

But what about the `$answer` variable which is the **"actual result"**?

Instead of being provided as a positional argument, the "actual result" is available as a pre-defined variable.

## Get the actual result

Next, update the **`expect.matcher.toEq()`** function to print two things:

1.  Information about the arguments being passed to the function
2.  All of the currently defined variables which start with `EXPECT_`

    ```sh
    expect.matcher.toEq() {
      echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
      declare -p | grep EXPECT_
    }
    ```

    > You can redefine the above function right in your BASH shell, just copy/paste it in!  
    > It will replace the previous function definition.

Now, try running the code again. This time, set a value for `$answer`:

- ```sh
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ answer="This is the actual result"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: 42
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="This is the actual result"
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_END_PATTERN="^[\\]}]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_START_PATTERN="^[\\[{]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.0"
  ```

  > A summary of all `EXPECT_` variables is [found below](#foo) under [Supported `EXPECT` variables](#foo)

As you can see, there a number of `EXPECT_` variables available to the function.

The **"actual result"** is available in a variable named **`EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT`**:

- ```sh
  declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="This is the actual result"
  ```

## Compare actual and expected results

The `toEq` matcher function now has access to both the **"expected result"** and **"actual result"**.

Update the function to compare the expected and actual retults:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"                  # e.g. 42
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT" # e.g. "This is the actual result"

    if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      echo "They match! This matcher should pass."
    else
      echo "Oh noes! They are not the same! This matcher should fail."
    fi
  }
  ```

Now, run the function again providing a variety of expected and actual values:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42
  # They match! This matcher should pass.

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42-42
  # Oh noes! They are not the same! This matcher should fail.
  ```

## Write failure messages

It would be more useful if the matcher provided more info about failures when they occur.

Update the function to print out the **"actual result"** and the **"expected result"** when it fails:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

    if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      echo "They match! I guess we don't need to print anything when it passes..."
    else
      echo "Expected values to equal"
      echo "Actual: $actualResult"
      echo "Expected: $expectedResult"
    fi
  }
  ```

Now, run the function again providing a variety of expected and actual values:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42
  # They match! I guess we don't need to print anything when it passes..

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42-42
  # Expected values to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42-42-42-42
  ```

That's more useful!

## Negating with 'not'

What about handling when `not` is provided?

```sh
$ expect "$answer" not toEq 42
```

Right now, the `expect.matcher.toEq()` function does not support `not`.

To see how to support using `not`, print out the `EXPECT` variables again:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
    declare -p | grep EXPECT_
  }
  ```
- ```sh
  $ expect "Hello" toEq "World"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: World
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="Hello"
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_END_PATTERN="^[\\]}]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_START_PATTERN="^[\\[{]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.0"

  $ expect "Hello" not toEq "World"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: World
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="Hello"
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_END_PATTERN="^[\\]}]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_START_PATTERN="^[\\[{]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT="true"
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.0"
  ```

When the `not` keyword comes before the name of the matcher `EXPECT_NOT` is set to `"true"`.

Update the function to support when `not` is used:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

    if [ "$EXPECT_NOT" = "true" ]
    then
      # Expect values NOT to be equal.
      #
      # If they are equal, show a failure message.
      if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
      then
        echo "Expected values not to equal"
        echo "Actual: $actualResult"
        echo "Not Expected: $expectedResult"
      fi
    else
      # Expect values to be equal.
      #
      # If they are not equal, show a failure message.
      if [ "$actualResult" != "$expectedResult" ]
      then
        echo "Expected values to equal"
        echo "Actual: $actualResult"
        echo "Expected: $expectedResult"
      fi
    fi
  }
  ```

Now run the function with and without the `not` keyword:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42
  # Expected values to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42-42-42

  $ expect 42 not toEq 42-42-42

  $ expect 42 not toEq 42
  # Expected values not to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42
  ```

Wonderful! Looking great!

However, right now, a test would not fail because the function does not `return 1` or `exit 1`.

## Exit on failure

There are two common ways to "fail" an assertion or expectation in BASH test frameworks:

1.  `return 1` _(or any non-zero code)_
2.  `exit 1` _(or any non-zero code)_

Test frameworks that fail whenever a command `return 1` usually do this via `set -e`.

There are pros and cons to each approach.

`expect` can be used in either type of framework by using `expect.fail()`.

Here is the source code for the `expect.fail()` function from [`expect.sh`](https://github.com/bx-sh/expect.sh/blob/master/expect.sh):

- ```sh
  EXPECTATION_FAILED="exit 1"

  expect.fail() {
    echo -e "$*" >&2
    $EXPECTATION_FAILED
  }
  ```

By default, `expect` will `exit 1` whenever the `expect.fail()` function is called.

> Note: if you test this in your BASH shell, your shell will close and exit!

If you want to use `expect` in a framework like `Bats` which uses `set -e`:

- ```sh
  # Set the value of EXPECTATION_FAILED anywhere in your code before you use 'expect'
  EXPECTATION_FAILED="return 1"
  ```

Now, update the **`expect.matcher.toEq()`** function to call `expect.fail` on failure:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

    if [ "$EXPECT_NOT" = "true" ]
    then
      # Expect values NOT to be equal.
      #
      # If they are equal, show a failure message.
      if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
      then
        expect.fail "Expected values not to equal\nActual: $actualResult\nNot Expected: $expectedResult"
      fi
    else
      # Expect values to be equal.
      #
      # If they are not equal, show a failure message.
      if [ "$actualResult" != "$expectedResult" ]
      then
        expect.fail "Expected values to equal\nActual: $actualResult\nExpected: $expectedResult"
      fi
    fi
  }
  ```

In your shell, set `EXPECTATION_FAILED="return 1"` and then try the function:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42

  $ echo $?
  # 0

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42
  # Expected values to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42-42-42

  $ echo $?
  # 1

  $ expect 42 not toEq 42-42-42

  $ echo $?
  # 0

  $ expect 42 not toEq 42
  # Expected values not to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42

  $ echo $?
  # 1
  ```

**Reminder:** your function will `return` the exit status of the last command or function executed.

- If you plan to run any commands after you call `expect.fail()`, it is best practice to end your matcher with `return 0`
- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

    if [ "$EXPECT_NOT" = "true" ]
    then
      # Expect values NOT to be equal.
      # <...>
    else
      # Expect values to be equal.
      # <...>
    fi

    return 0
  }
  ```

## Block values

One limitation of using `expect "some value" toEq "another value"` is:

- The **"actual result"** can only be _ony value_, e.g. "some value"

But what if the value you are testing against is multiple values?

- e.g. You want to `expect "$@" toEq something"` (in BASH `"$@"` expands to multiple values)
- e.g. You want a command and arguments which your matcher will execute

If you want your matcher to take a command and arguments, you could try:

- `expect "command arg1 arg2" toRunSuccessfully`

But this runs into problems if you need to quote argument values:

- `expect "command 'Hello World' 'Value with spaces'" toRunSuccessfully`

To solve this problem, `expect` provides **blocks**:

- `expect { a list of things } toMeetMyExpectations`

By default, you can wrap your block in any number of curly braces or brackets:

- `expect { a list of things } toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect {{ a list of things }} toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect {{{ a list of things }}} toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect [ a list of things ] toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect [[ a list of things ]] toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect [[[ a list of things ]]] toMeetMyExpectations`

This provides flexibility, e.g. if you want `{` and `{{` to behave differently.

### Example

The matchers which come with `expect.sh` all support using `{` or `{{`

When `{` is used, the block is executed to get the actual result

When `{{` is used, the block is executed _in a subshell_ to get the actual result

### `EXPECT_BLOCK`

To see how to support blocks, print out the `EXPECT` variables again:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
    declare -p | grep EXPECT_
  }
  ```
- ```sh
  $ expect "Hello" toEq "something"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: something
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="Hello"
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_END_PATTERN="^[\\]}]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_START_PATTERN="^[\\[{]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.2"

  $ expect { "Hello" } toEq "something"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: something
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT=""
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=([0]="Hello")
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_END_PATTERN="^[\\]}]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_START_PATTERN="^[\\[{]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE="{"
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.2"

  $ expect [[ "Hello" there, "how are" you? ]] toEq "something"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: something
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT=""
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=([0]="Hello" [1]="there," [2]="how are" [3]="you?")
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_END_PATTERN="^[\\]}]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_START_PATTERN="^[\\[{]+\$"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE="[["
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.2"
  ```

As you can see, the content of the block is available in the `EXPECT_BLOCK` BASH array.

The symbol used for the block is available as `EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE`, e.g. `{` or `[[`.

If your matcher does not require the block syntax, fail your matcher when a block is provided:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    # If the block length is greater than one, fail the matcher with a message
    if [ "${#EXPECT_BLOCK[@]}" -gt 0 ]
    then
      expect.fail "toEq does not support block syntax"
    fi
    # ...
  }
  ```

If you want to support executing commands, like the provided matchers, follow the next section.

## Support block syntax

This provides an example implementation for executing block commands in matchers, e.g.

- ```sh
  expect { ls } toEq "file1\nfile2"
  ```

The `expect.matcher.toEq()` function will support three types of syntax:

- `expect "simple value" toEq "something"`
- `expect { command args } toEq "something"` - run command and verify its output
- `expect {{ command args }} toEq "something"` - run command in subshell and verify its output
