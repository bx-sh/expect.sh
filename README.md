## `expect`

The `expect` function provides a simple framework for authoring and using "expectations"

```sh
local config="file.conf"

expect "$config" toBeValidConfig

expect { deployed --configs } not toContain "$config"

expect { deploy "$config" } toDeploySuccessfully

expect { deployed --configs } toContain "$config"
```

> ‚ÑπAll applications and scripts are different.
>
> Please use this to implement your own domain-specific expectations for your tests.

# Authoring Expectations

## Expectations vs Assertions

The two most common test assertion styles in programming languages are:

> #### `assert`
>
> ```sh
> assert_equal "ACTUAL", "EXPECTED"
> ```

> #### `expect`
>
> ```sh
> expect "ACTUAL" equals "EXPECTED"
> ```

There are pros and cons to each, but at the end of the day it comes down to user preference.

`assert`

- Pros:
  - Classic ü•Ç
  - Easy to implement additional `assert_*` functions
- Cons:
  - Easy to forget which argument is `actual` and which is `expected`
  - Requires many `assert_*` functions
    > in BASH, these "pollute" the global namespace

`expect`

- Pros:
  - Reads closer to normal language, e.g. _expect '\$result' to equal 'foo'_
  - Only requires one top-level `expect` function
    > in BASH, this means not "polluting" the global namespace with extra functions
- Cons:
  - Slightly more complicated to implement additional `expect` matchers
    > ... as you'll see below! You'll implement a variety of matchers üçª

## Matcher functions

Let's implement the following **`toEq`** "matcher function"

```sh
expect "$answer" toEq 42
```

First, try running the above code _without_ implementing the function:

- ```sh
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  expect.matcher.toEq: command not found
  ```

You'll see an error: **`expect.matcher.toEq: command not found`**

By default, `expect` expects a function to exist named `expect.matcher.[MATCHER_NAME]`

The name of the matcher in this case is: `toEq`.

## Write a matcher function

Next, add that function: **`expect.matcher.toEq()`**

To start with, just print out one thing:

1.  Information about the arguments being passed to the function

    ```sh
    expect.matcher.toEq() {
      echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
    }
    ```

    > You can define the above function right in your BASH shell, just copy/paste it in!

Now, try running the code again:

- ```
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  toEq called with 1 arguments: 42
  ```

Wonderful! This time the command did not fail and the `toEq` function was called.

As you can see, the `toEq` function received one positional argument: `42`

This is considered the **"expected result"**.

- > #### Optional
  >
  > Try passing additional arguments to `toEq`
  >
  > ```sh
  > $ expect "$answer" toEq 42 another argument "hello, world!"
  > toEq called with 4 arguments: 42 another argument hello, world!
  > ```

But what about the `$answer` variable which is the **"actual result"**?

Instead of being provided as a positional argument, the "actual result" is available as a pre-defined variable.

## Get the actual result

Next, update the **`expect.matcher.toEq()`** function to print two things:

1.  Information about the arguments being passed to the function
2.  All of the currently defined variables which start with `EXPECT_`

    ```sh
    expect.matcher.toEq() {
      echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
      declare -p | grep EXPECT_
    }
    ```

    > You can redefine the above function right in your BASH shell, just copy/paste it in!  
    > It will replace the previous function definition.

Now, try running the code again. This time, set a value for `$answer`:

- ```
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ answer="This is the actual result"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  toEq called with 1 arguments: 42
  declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="This is the actual result"
  declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_END_PATTERN="^[\\]}]+\$"
  declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_START_PATTERN="^[\\[{]+\$"
  declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.0"
  ```

As you can see, there a number of `EXPECT_` variables available to the function.

The **"actual result"** is available in a variable named `EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT`:

- ```
  declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="This is the actual result"
  ```

> A summary of all `EXPECT_` variables is [found below](#foo) under [Supported `EXPECT` variables](#foo)

## Compare actual and expected results

With access to both the **"expected result"** and **"actual result"**, update the function to compare them:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"                  # e.g. 42
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT" # e.g. "This is the actual result"

    if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      echo "They match! This matcher should pass."
    else
      echo "Oh noes! They are not the same! This matcher should fail."
    fi
  }
  ```

Now, run the function again providing a variety of expected and actual values:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42
  They match! This matcher should pass.

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42-42
  Oh noes! They are not the same! This matcher should fail.
  ```

## Write failure messages

It would be more useful if, when the function failed, it provided more info.

Update the function to print out the **"actual result"** and the **"expected result"** when it fails:

- ```sh
  ...
  ```
